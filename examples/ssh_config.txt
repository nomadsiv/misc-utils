# this assumes you have the id_rsa files for each of the two github identities present in the .ssh dir.
# If you don't have the id_rsa files, then create them with ssh-keygen cmd
# then when cloning the repo's from each of the git accounts, use respectively:
#>git clone git@aditi-git:aditi/cool-repo-a.git
#>git clone git@balu-git:balu/vet-repo-b.git
